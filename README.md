#ONF-Certified-Associate-Study-notes
My intent is to keep the resources to those publicly available. While there are some books out, this is still a rapidly evolving technology so books will very likely be slightly behind the state of the art in SDN, that said, there are some good ones and I will list them also (at least those I have read).
_First for a list of resources_
###Web resources
1. [The Packet Pushers] (http://www.packetpushers.net) podcasts (hosted by Ethan Banks, Greg Ferro, Drew Conray-Murray, Chris Wahl) are very good with regards to networking and IT and there are a couple of really good podcasts that cover sdn, openflow  and some great conversations with some "VERY" knowledgeable hosts. 
2. [Matt Oswalt] (http://www.keepingitclassless.net) has a series on OpenFlow.
3. [Brent Salisbury] (http://www.networkstatic.net) has some openflow and sdn articles
4. There is a very good series by Sridhar Rao at [thenewstack.io] (http://thenewstack.io/author/sridharrao/)
