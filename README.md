#ONF-Certified-Associate-Study-notes
Study notes for the ONF Associate exam. <!-- Those for the Engineer exam are linked [here] (http://www.). -->  <!-- I decided to use github as it would also help me to learn and become familiar with github at the same time. An excellent way to learn github is through the [Committmas] (http://www.) page. I wasn't quite able to tag along, but rewatching? the videos later on was super helpful. Other great resources include [the] (http://www.) [following] (http://www.) [Youtube] (http://www.) [playlists] (http://www.). I have used mostly public resources and have tried linking to them when I can. I also used the [ Oreilly book ] (http://www.); if textbooks are more your thing, [these] (http://www.) [seem] (http://www.) [to] (http://www.) [be] (http://www.) [good] (http://www.), but I haven't read them so caveat emptor. There are tons of [videos] (http://www.) [on] (http://www.) [Youtube] (http://www.) [that] (http://www.) [can] (http://www.) [get] (http://www.) [one] (http://www.) [up] (http://www.) [to] (http://www.) [speed] (http://www.) [quickly] (http://www.). These are just a few, search for [SDN] (http://www.), [OpenFlow] (http://www.), or any of the other buzz words. -->


Great blogs and other resources that may be useful.
