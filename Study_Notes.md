This is a repository to track my preparation for the ONF Certified Associate Certification. The Blue Print is obtained from the ONF site and for authoritative and updated topics, kindly visit https://www.opennetworking.org/certification/skills.org. The material is from a variety of sites online, youtube videos and SDN books. As much as I can, I will be linking the source of the materials. Any omission is not deliberate and I will endeavour to cite as many sources as possible.
